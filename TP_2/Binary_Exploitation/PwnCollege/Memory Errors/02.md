running the challenge gives the info that the buffer is 36 bytes, however for some reason, it doesnt work so I tried 37 instead and it worked.

Directly cant put 37 a's and then the required value as it wont take the input as hex but rather as characters. To properly set the values, we need to use python and convert it to binary.

Flag: ```pwn.college{0SPJV5u3aqGwN6tonqJhuFoUV0N.ddTNzMDLxEzN0czW}```

The challenge() function has just been launched!
Before we do anything, let's take a look at challenge()'s stack frame:

+---------------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------+
Our stack pointer points to 0x7ffebdaf69d0, and our base pointer points to 0x7ffebdaf6a40.
This means that we have (decimal) 16 8-byte words in our stack frame,
including the saved base pointer and the saved return address, for a
total of 128 bytes.
The input buffer begins at 0x7ffebdaf6a10, partway through the stack frame,
("above" it in the stack are other local variables used by the function).
Your input will be read into this buffer.
The buffer is 36 bytes long, but the program will let you provide an arbitrarily
large input length, and thus overflow the buffer.

In this level, there is a "win" variable.
By default, the value of this variable is zero.
However, if you can set variable to 0x4ea30ed8, the flag will be printed.
You can change this variable by overflowing the input buffer, but keep endianness in mind!
The "win" variable is stored at 0x7ffebdaf6a34, 36 bytes after the start of your input buffer.

Payload size: You have chosen to send 50 bytes of input!
This will allow you to write from 0x7ffebdaf6a10 (the start of the input buffer)
right up to (but not including) 0x7ffebdaf6a42 (which is 14 bytes beyond the end of the buffer).
Send your payload (up to 50 bytes)!
You sent 40 bytes!
Let's see what happened with the stack:

The program's memory status:
- the input buffer starts at 0x7ffebdaf6a10
- the saved frame pointer (of main) is at 0x7ffebdaf6a40
- the saved return address (previously to main) is at 0x7ffebdaf6a48
- the saved return address is now pointing to 0x60c77118a86d.
- the canary is stored at 0x7ffebdaf6a38.
- the canary value is now 0x3ad43fad56526800.
- the address of the win variable is 0x7ffebdaf6a34.
- the value of the win variable is 0x4ea30ed8.

You win! Here is your flag:
