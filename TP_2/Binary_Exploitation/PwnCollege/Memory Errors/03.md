Similar to the previous challenge but this time we had to change the value of the return address of challenge instead so it went directly to win(). Exact same as last challenge, just with a different offset.

Flag : ```pwn.college{c0UbfDEyecSdO_TFOsv4OcsIIzp.01M5IDLxEzN0czW}```

The challenge() function has just been launched!
Before we do anything, let's take a look at challenge()'s stack frame:

+---------------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------+
Our stack pointer points to 0x7ffc515770b0, and our base pointer points to 0x7ffc51577130.
This means that we have (decimal) 18 8-byte words in our stack frame,
including the saved base pointer and the saved return address, for a
total of 144 bytes.
The input buffer begins at 0x7ffc515770e0, partway through the stack frame,
("above" it in the stack are other local variables used by the function).
Your input will be read into this buffer.
The buffer is 61 bytes long, but the program will let you provide an arbitrarily
large input length, and thus overflow the buffer.

In this level, there is no "win" variable.
You will need to force the program to execute the win() function
by directly overflowing into the stored return address back to main,
which is stored at 0x7ffc51577138, 88 bytes after the start of your input buffer.
That means that you will need to input at least 96 bytes (61 to fill the buffer,
27 to fill other stuff stored between the buffer and the return address,
and 8 that will overwrite the return address).

We have disabled the following standard memory corruption mitigations for this challenge:
- the canary is disabled, otherwise you would corrupt it before
overwriting the return address, and the program would abort.
- the binary is *not* position independent. This means that it will be
located at the same spot every time it is run, which means that by
analyzing the binary (using objdump or reading this output), you can
know the exact value that you need to overwrite the return address with.

Payload size: You have chosen to send 150 bytes of input!
This will allow you to write from 0x7ffc515770e0 (the start of the input buffer)
right up to (but not including) 0x7ffc51577176 (which is 89 bytes beyond the end of the buffer).
Of these, you will overwrite 62 bytes into the return address.
If that number is greater than 8, you will overwrite the entire return address.

You will want to overwrite the return value from challenge()
(located at 0x7ffc51577138, 88 bytes past the start of the input buffer)
with 0x401dd4, which is the address of the win() function.
This will cause challenge() to return directly into the win() function,
which will in turn give you the flag.
Keep in mind that you will need to write the address of the win() function
in little-endian (bytes backwards) so that it is interpreted properly.

Send your payload (up to 150 bytes)!
You sent 91 bytes!
Let's see what happened with the stack:

The program's memory status:
- the input buffer starts at 0x4141414141414141
- the saved frame pointer (of main) is at 0x7ffc51577130
- the saved return address (previously to main) is at 0x7ffc51577138
- the saved return address is now pointing to 0x401dd4.
- the address of win() is 0x401dd4.

If you have managed to overwrite the return address with the correct value,
challenge() will jump straight to win() when it returns.
Let's try it now!

Goodbye!
You win! Here is your flag:
