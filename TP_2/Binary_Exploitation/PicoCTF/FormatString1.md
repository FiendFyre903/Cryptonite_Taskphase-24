# Format String 0

**Flag:** `picoCTF{4n1m41_57y13_4x4_f14g_5e67bcb4}`

- **step 1**

    Since the buf (input) was printed directly without usign %s, any format specifiers would be interepreted by printf. 

    Therefore using a lot of `%p` gives us a bunch of hexadecimal values, which using codechef can be converted to ascii.

    After deleting the hex's that didnt convert to ascii, I had to reverse and rearrange the hexes to get the correct flag.

**What I learned:**

1. String format specifiers in C

**Other incorrect methods I tried:**

- None
