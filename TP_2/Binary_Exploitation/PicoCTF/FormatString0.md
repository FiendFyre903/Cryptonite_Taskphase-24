# Format String 0

**Flag:** `picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_c8362f05}`

- **step 1**


    Patricks burger needed to have over 64 characters when printed , and only one burger fulfilled that

    The first burger was Gr%114d_Cheese because it had `%114d` which would a lot(114) of extra characters that was needed to fulfill the condition.

- **step 2**

    Bob needed a burger that would break the shop , aka would cause some issue in the code. 

    This meant Cla%sic_Che%s%steak was the burger needed here since without providing a string will cause segmentation fault, which the program will detect and then print the flag.

**What I learned:**

1. String format specifiers in C
2. %d didnt give error tho %s did, when the required data was not mentioned for either.

**Other incorrect methods I tried:**

- None
