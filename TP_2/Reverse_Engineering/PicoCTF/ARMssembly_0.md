# ARMssembly 0

**Flag:** `picoCTF{F51E846F}`



- **step 1**

    After analysing the program, it basically prints the larger of the two arguments.

    arg1 = 4112417903

    arg2 = 1169092511

    here arg1 is bigger, so hex representation of it is the flag.



**What I learned:**

1. Basic Assembly and little bit about ARM

**Other incorrect methods I tried:**

- I tried reversing it to C because it mentioned something about chall.c but couldnt do that.
